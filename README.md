**Crypto user → Builder → Systems Thinker**

### 🧠 About Me

I approach software like a **debugger**.

I like to use systems as a **user first**, understand how they behave under the hood, trace the logic, and then build tools around that understanding.

Started as a crypto & blockchain user.  
Got curious about *how things actually work*.  
Now actively building and experimenting in the **EVM / Web3 ecosystem**.

### 🧩 How I Think & Work

- 🛠 Understand systems by breaking & tracing them  
- 🔍 Focus on **core logic**, not surface-level features  
- 🧪 Learn by building small, real tools  
- 🧠 Curious about how protocols behave in practice

### 🔥 What I’m Building / Exploring

- ⚙️ Smart contracts & EVM experiments  
- 🔐 Non-custodial wallets (CLI & Android)  
- 🟣 Farcaster mini apps & on-chain games  
- 💸 DeFi utilities (faucets, bridges, explorers)  
- 🧰 Small tools that solve specific problems
